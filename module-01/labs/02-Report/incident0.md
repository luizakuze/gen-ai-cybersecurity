The cyber attack unfolded in a multi-stage timeline, starting with the initial compromise on day one. During this phase, the threat actors employed a malicious attachment carrying a custom-designed trojan, carefully crafted to bypass traditional antivirus detection mechanisms.
Moving to the establishing persistence phase on day seven, the attackers initiated command and control (C2) activities. They successfully established a covert communication channel to external servers, providing them with remote control capabilities over the compromised system.
In the lateral movement and reconnaissance phase during weeks two through four, attackers leveraged compromised credentials to move laterally across the network. They meticulously mapped the organization\'s infrastructure and executed privilege escalation strategies, exploiting vulnerabilities in unpatched systems. This strategy allowed the threat actors to elevate their privileges, gaining access to critical servers and databases.
During the data exfiltration phase in weeks five and six, the APT group focused on identifying and exfiltrating sensitive customer financial data. The attackers utilized encrypted channels to avoid detection and adopted a subtle approach, slowly exfiltrating data in small, inconspicuous quantities.
