# Malware Incident Response Playbook

## **Objective**
Provide a structured approach to respond to and mitigate the impact of a malware attack, specifically targeting customer and vendor data.

---

## **Phases of Response**

### **1. Preparation**
- Ensure the Incident Response (IR) team is alerted and activated.
- Review and update response procedures.
- Gather tools required for malware analysis and eradication (e.g., antivirus, endpoint detection and response tools).
- Notify stakeholders, including legal and compliance teams, of the potential impact on customer and vendor data.

### **2. Identification**
- **Key Actions**:
  - Identify affected systems and endpoints.
  - Determine the type and scope of the malware.
  - Check for unauthorized access to customer/vendor data.
- **Tools/Techniques**:
  - Analyze logs (firewall, network, and system logs) for signs of compromise.
  - Use malware detection tools to confirm the presence of malicious files.
  - Examine suspicious activity (e.g., anomalous outbound network traffic).

### **3. Containment**
- **Short-Term Actions**:
  - Isolate infected systems from the network to prevent further spread.
  - Disable compromised accounts and revoke access.
- **Long-Term Actions**:
  - Segment the network to limit lateral movement.
  - Deploy updates to antivirus and endpoint protection tools.

### **4. Eradication**
- Remove the malware from infected systems.
  - Use antivirus/malware removal tools or manually delete malicious files.
- Patch vulnerabilities exploited by the malware.
- Change passwords and strengthen access controls.

### **5. Recovery**
- Restore affected systems from clean backups.
  - Ensure backups are malware-free before restoring.
- Validate system functionality and integrity.
- Monitor restored systems for any signs of residual infection or reinfection.

### **6. Notification**
- Notify impacted customers and vendors as required by applicable regulations.
  - Provide details of the incident, actions taken, and steps they should follow.
- Notify relevant regulatory authorities, if necessary.

### **7. Lessons Learned**
- Conduct a post-incident review to:
  - Assess the effectiveness of the response.
  - Identify gaps in current security measures.
- Update the Incident Response Plan (IRP) based on findings.

## **Communication Plan**
- **Internal Communication**:
  - Keep executives, IT teams, and legal teams informed of response progress.
- **External Communication**:
  - Prepare a public statement, if necessary, to address customer and vendor concerns.

---

## **Preventative Measures**
- Regularly update systems and software to patch vulnerabilities.
- Conduct phishing awareness training for employees.
- Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor for malicious activity.
- Implement least-privilege access controls to limit exposure.
- Perform regular backups and test the restoration process.
